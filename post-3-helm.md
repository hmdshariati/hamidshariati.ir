as a report to myself and who care about that:

in the bellow job opertunity :

https://jobinja.ir/companies/rayankar/jobs/Ra2R/

I had a duty to deploy a helm chart according to the this repository: https://github.com/mason-chase/dev-ops-test

first of all I should had learn ( یاد می‌گرفتم ) ?? helm.

when I start learning ther are not any chartrep/chartname (stupid :-|). so I found some good help from this stackoverflow link: https://github.com/mason-chase/dev-ops-test that I could add helm stable repo https://charts.helm.sh/stable.


# what's HELM

according the original documents https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/ helm is a package for kubernetes. In my opinion that means it causes punctual job when you are working with k8s. 

Even I have not knew kubernetes perfrectly I dive into the pool of documentations to start and try my luck. ?? (am I write?)

So I started practice on HELM with new repo: https://github.com/hmdshariati/HELM

During this practice, thanks to writing this post in parallel, I founded that it's not really important to do your task during a dead line. I know it's morally (اخلاقی) ?? but you should respect yourself at first. Maybe you have taken high weight stone ??

During reading HELM documentation I found light mode can be better to me (2 a.m). I don't know why Nava said that once but it's better  to search it once.

There are some points in every Iraninan life, that see big wall in front of us, Sanction.
