From my experiences, I result in never do it immedietely. It may change.

When I was coding in drdr.ir, one of my tasks had forces (all tasks have force) and I was pushing by team to complete it and start new task.

New task was migration and CTO made me ?? that if you complete old tasks you can start migration. 

Excactly that day he said me a changing related to my old task that changed all my works before. 

This situation had been occured a lot to me and I wanted to write and remember it: Never act immedietely.

Here is a good place to tell your thinkings completely, because even if you said it to anybody they never give ?? to you. Rarely they ?? themself to you. The first one who care about your ability is yourself
